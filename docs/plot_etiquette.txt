DATA VISUALIZATION GUIDELINES FOR CODE GENERATION

1. Maximize Data-to-Ink Ratio
    - Remove unnecessary gridlines, borders, and decorations
    - Every visual element must convey information
    - Simplify when possible without losing clarity

2. Label All Elements
    - Every axis must have a descriptive label with units
    - Title should clearly describe what is plotted
    - Use figure captions to explain context and findings

3. Appropriate Scaling and Zoom
    - Adjust axis limits to show relevant data range
    - Avoid misleading truncated axes
    - Ensure plots are readable when embedded in documents

4. Professional Typography
    - Use consistent, readable fonts (e.g., sans-serif)
    - Ensure font size is legible (minimum 10pt for embedded plots)
    - Match font styling across all plots in a document

5. Honest Data Representation
    - Always verify axis ranges are not manipulated deceptively
    - Include error bars or confidence intervals when applicable
    - Clearly mark any data transformations or outlier removals

6. Meaningful Axis Intervals
    - Use round numbers for tick marks when possible
    - Space ticks to avoid overcrowding
    - Include secondary axis labels if needed for clarity

7. Include Legends and Annotations
    - Add legends for multiple series/colors with clear descriptions
    - Annotate important points or thresholds
    - Use text annotations sparingly and relevantly

8. Effective Color Usage
    - Use colorblind-friendly palettes
    - Ensure colors add information, not decoration
    - Justify each color choice in relation to data

9. Logical Subplot Organization
    - Arrange subplots in intuitive grid layouts
    - Use consistent scales across related subplots
    - Share axes when appropriate to aid comparison

10. Optimize for Context
     - Match plot style to publication venue
     - Consider aspect ratio for intended display medium
     - Balance aesthetic appeal with information density
